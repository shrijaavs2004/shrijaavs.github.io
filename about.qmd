About this site



Hi there! I’m Shrijaa, a Master of Data Science student at UBC. I love working with data, solving problems, and finding creative ways to make sense of information. Outside of academics, I’ve been learning South Indian Classical music for many years, and I also enjoy sketching, craft work, reading fiction, and playing badminton. I like building projects with friends, organizing workshops, and being part of tech communities. This site is where I’ll share a bit about myself and my journey in data science!
